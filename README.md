PyConsole
=========

This is a tkinter based console that can be run from within python.

This code originally came from the site little fantasy world's [python collection](http://lfw.org/python/) (scroll most of the way down to Console.py) and was originally written by Ka-Ping Yee <ping@lfw.org>, on 18 April 1999 and released into the public domain.
